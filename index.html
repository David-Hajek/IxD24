<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> Welcome to the introduction of my IxD project, the focus is on gamifying a already existing learning app. Our goal is to make the learning experiece enjoyable, engaging and interactive for users. </p>
<p> Gamification involvse the process, of applying game desing principles to non-game contexts, such as learning. The objective being, to increase the users motivation, engagement and enjoyment </p>
<p> This project is split into multiple phases, including a competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. </p>
<p>The analysis will help me identify the strengths and weaknesses in the existing market, and show the areas that can be improved </p>
<p>Wireframing and prototyping allowed us to design and develop the interface and UX of the app, ensuring a smooth learning process. </p>
<p>Finally, usability testing was conducted to gather feedback from users on the app's usability and its functionality. The feedback will be used to refine and improve the app, ensuring that all the user's needs are met. </p>
<p>Our aim is to create a learning app, that is effective and enjoyable, improving user satisfaction and the learner's outcomes. </p>
